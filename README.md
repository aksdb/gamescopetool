# gamescopetool

A simple wrapper around gamescope that synchronizes the clipboard.

The name is a bit broad, but I intend(ed) to give this a few more
convenience functions. I'll get back to that ...

Simply replace your `gamescope` call with `gamescopetool` and all
should work.

## Build

You need Go 1.18. Then simply run `go build` in the directory you
checked out.
